# beneath-the-mask
A simple website that plays a version of "Beneath the Mask" from Persona 5, depending on the weather and day conditions in your area.
Inspired largely by the tane.us Animal Crossing music website my Brian Lee (https://tane.us/ac/), and utilizes the OpenWeather Current Weather Data API (https://openweathermap.org/current).

There are 4 versions of Beneath the Mask that the website can choose, depending on the weather and whether it's daytime or nighttime:
- Beneath the Mask -instrumental version- ~ Day theme (6:00 - 17:59)
- Beneath the Mask ~ Night theme (18:00 - 5:59)
- Beneath the Mask -rain, instrumental version- ~ Rainy/snowy day theme
- Beneath the Mask -rain- ~ Rainy/snowy night theme
